# Excellent Games Repository

This is a simple website built with bootstrap to showcase the games I built in Unity. You can check out the archive [here](https://www.excellent.games)

This website features three games: Balls, Asteroid Busters, and Tanks DEMO.

### Balls

Balls was a game that a team and I built for the Game Programming class. It is inspired by the Marble Blast series, but has a unique take on the game: You can change your ball that allows you to solve a certain obstacle, and each ball has different properties. the **Tennis** ball for instance is small and nimble, and allows you to pass through tight spaces. The **Bowling Ball** is large and heavy, and allows you to clear large gaps that smaller balls would fall right through. The **Basket Ball** is very bouncy, and allows you to jump to higher platforms. Finally, the **Soccer** ball allows you to build up speed and clear large gaps. We had a lot of fun working on Balls, and hopefully you will enjoy playing it!!

### Asteroid Busters

Asteroid Busters was a game that I created for a midterm, but expanded to play around with Unity. It is basically a side-scroller that allows you to tap the space bar to change direction, and dodge endless asteroids. The game features six different ships that you can unlock, depending on the number of asteroids you can dodge, and interesting powerups that you can pick up.

### Tanks Demo

I wanted to experiment with third person vehicle gameplay, as well as networking... hence, Tanks was born. In its current form, the player controller is mostly complete, and it allows you to drive around the various terrains I generated for the game, and shoot projectiles.
